			In real life, you have assets like a home. They can't get loss, and even after a person dies, their assets transfer to their next beneficiary, right? Yeah..! So why not do the same with the same valuable digital assets like coins, tokens, and NFT? Most times, when a person dies or misplaces his private key, his cryptocurrencies are lost forever on the blockchain, and over $10 billion worth of bitcoin alone has been lost due to this.

			Bequest Protocol allows you to transfer your assets to a beneficiary in decentralised manner. You sign the request by providing beneficiary details such as wallet address and request execution time.
